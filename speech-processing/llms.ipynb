      "Hi guys, today we're taking a look at one of the latest 2024 OLED TVs from LG. This is the LG OLED Evo G4 which is LG's flagship 4K OLED TV for 2024. Details are in the description below including purchasing links. So I've got the 65 inch version here which is not only great for movies but also perfect for gaming as it has HDMI 2.1 ports supporting a refresh rate up to 144Hz. And it's also worth mentioning LG's celebrating its fourth year as a leader and it's also worth mentioning that LG's celebrating their 11th year as the leader in selling OLED TVs with them introducing their first TV back in 2023. Back in 2013. So I'll be showing you around the design of the G4, the ports it has, setting it up and testing it out for general usage. So watching movies, TV shows, using streaming services and gaming to see what the picture quality is like together with seeing how well it performs. So hopefully this video will give you an idea of whether it's worth getting or not. Plus I'll highlight any positives and negatives I've found regarding it. But before I begin if you're new to the channel hope you can support me by subscribing and hitting the bell icon to get notified of my next release. And if you have any questions but before I begin if you're new to the channel hope you can support me by subscribing and hitting the bell icon to get notified of my next release. And if you have any questions drop them in the comments section. And if you have any questions drop them in the comment section below. The TV comes in a large box and due to its size it's definitely worth getting someone to help. The TV comes in a large box and due to its size it's definitely worth getting someone to give you a hand setting it up. Removing the straps on either side and cutting open the top reveals your accessories. There's a bag containing a remote control, some batteries, an IR blaster cable with two small stickers and some paperwork. There's also a box containing the wall mount accessories which includes a bag of screws and raw plugs, some small stickers used for mounting, a template used for installation purposes, some instructions and a warranty card and the wall bracket. Lifting the box off and removing the foam protectors you can then lift out the TV from the packaging and place it on a clean flat surface. Looking at the back of the top, looking at the back of the TV, at the top you have a point where you can mount. Looking at the back of the TV, at the top you have the point where the mount, you have the point where the wall mount bracket you get in the packaging hooks onto and you also have a 300 by 300 millimeter VESA mounting point. Ports wise, along the side you've got a common interface. Ports wise, along the side you've got a common interface with a USB input and two HDMI 2.1 ports. Ports wise, along the side you have a common interface with a USB input and two HDMI 2.1 ports with a second one supporting eARC and ARC. There's another set of ports which are downward facing and this is where you have your, and this is where you have the IR blaster input, a satellite and aerial input, an optical digital audio output, an ethernet connection port and two more HDMI 2.1 ports together with two USB input ports. It also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1. There's a channel to run your cables that has two cable management clips allowing you to clip your cables into place and below that you have a power cable that's attached and isn't removable. So something to be aware of if you're feeding cables through a narrow conduit. But on the positive side the cable is nice and long at 2.3 meters. The TV comes in five different, the TV is offered in five size options starting from 55 inches, 65, 77, 83 and a massive 7. The TV is offered in five different size options starting from 55 inches, 65 inches, 77 inches, 83 inches and a massive 97 inches and these all come with a wall mount. I've shown the dimensions for the 65 inch which is, I've shown the dimensions for the 65 inch, I've shown the dimensions on, I've shown the dimensions for the 65 inch which I have on the screen. So hit pause if you wanted to see those values. But it's worth noting if you do go for the 55 or 65 inch versions you have the option of buying the TV stand but it's worth noting if you do go for the 55 or 65 inch versions you have the option of buying the TV with either the TV stand or with a wall mount. The advantage of using the wall mount they've provided is that you're able to get the TV flush against the wall to give a literally flush against the wall to give literally a zero gap finish perfect for a minimalistic look where all cables are hidden. But I'm going to make use of my existing wall mount as I have a power strip directly behind the TV as I'll be installing an LED strip light behind the ambient lighting as I'll be installing an LED strip light behind it for ambient lighting so I want a slight gap behind there. With the TV mounted let me connect up the cables and feed the cable\n"
